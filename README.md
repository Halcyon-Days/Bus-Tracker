# Bus-Tracker-

Uses Translink API to access and display info for bus stops, and displays it in an android app. Some pictures can be found at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b_1MFvjnsY5Mo3diAi4UCyDxt_mlu6ya.

In order to use this app, you will need a API key from the Translink website https://developer.translink.ca/ServicesRtti. Create a new folder at \app\src\main\assets, and put a file in it called keyfile.txt containing just the API key.
